# space-physics-game

This is currently using Unity 2020.3.23f1, but I may update it to 2021.1 at some point.
This branch has lighting and stuff. It looks cool but the minimap shows the lighting, which it shouldn't because it's supposed to be radar. It also performs way worse than the original game without the lighting.
